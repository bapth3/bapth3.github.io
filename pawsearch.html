  <h3>
    Mission Statement
  </h3>
  <p>
    “To create a world, where lost/stray pets are taken care of”
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Our Problem
  </h3>
  <p>
    An issue that came to mind was animal strays. The reason this is important to us is because there have been many times when walking or driving down the street and we see stray animals and it makes us sad because that could be someone's animal that was lost or an animal that was abandoned. Some animals can get hurt or killed on their own and some are taken by strangers and never see their owners again. At the same there are dogs that owners won’t even come to look at and we can give them new owners. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    Our Solution
  </h3>
  <p>
    Our solution is to make an app where people in your community/area can speak with each other about lost animals that they have found or looking for. The way the app will work is you're going to put a zip code which will put you in a chat with other people in your zip code. They'll be able to send pictures of the lost pet and descriptions 
  </p>
 <h3>
   Our Competitive Edge
  </h3>
  <p>
    An edge we have is that we plan to also have a part for adoption instead of just giving them up to other adoption centers.
